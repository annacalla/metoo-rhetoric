Python Computational Text Analysis of News Coverage of the #MeToo Movement

After a series of high-profile sexual assault allegations against now infamous Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein flooded the news media in late 2017, the #MeToo movement began to spread virally.

The movement began as a hashtag on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. Tarana Burke, an American social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase 'Me Too' as early as 2006, and the phrase was later popularized by American actress Alyssa Milano, on Twitter in 2017.

Since the conception of the movement, hundreds of women (and men) have stepped into the spotlight to share their personal experiences of sexual harassment and assault with celebrities, partners, and coworkers alike.  For several months, the mainstream news media was consumed with stories on these allegations.  But the coverage of such a politicized modern social problem wasn't always objective. 

#### For this project, I chose to delve deeply into the rhetorical choices made by journalists writing for media outlets positioned on opposite ends of the political spectrum: Fox News Network and The New York Times. The blog post that follows will explain how I accomplished this.
